## [transltr](http://www.transltr.org/)
This service is unreliable, nukes all the punctuation, translation is sub average, very slow compared to the rest.

## [reverso](http://www.reverso.net/)
Appears to be another meta-translator, language codes used are numerical, weird pairing codes, very limited number of languages.
